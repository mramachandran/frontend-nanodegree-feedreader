# Project build overview

In this project I have taken time only to update the following files

a. feedreader.js
b. app.js

I have kept feedreader.js simple by wrapping the expect call to look for a particular function declared and implemented in app.js. Those functions return appropriate response 
which then compared against the test expectation. 

You do not need need any special build tools to run the program. All you need is to run index.html
